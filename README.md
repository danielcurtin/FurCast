<h1 align=center>üêæ FurCast üå¶Ô∏è</h1>

## Abstract
FurCast is a weather app for dog walkers! A user can enter their city or zipcode, and get their realtime weather information. They'll also get a note about the conditions and how they might affect their pup. IE. Hot weather would warn a user about heatstroke and hot pavement, while cold weather would give a warning toward prolonged exposure for thin coat dogs.

## App Usage
This app uses a Secret API Key so it's unable to be run locally. However, it can be used [here](https://danielcurtin.github.io/furcast/)

## Project Goal
Demonstrate Mastery in 
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress

## Wins + Challenges
- Win: This project was a big step up for me in responsiveness - getting all the different device sizes to display the data, sometimes uniquely, was challenging and rewarding.
- Challenge: The API documentation was a bit outdated, and sometimes calls that should otherwise work will time out. Navigating those errors and understanding when I was doing something wrong was kind of difficult
